# HOW TO USE THESE FILES AND PPT 
Basically what I have shown in the classroom is from the probability methods used in real-life scenarios and in general probability 

**Basic Needs**
 - Basics of Python 

## How to access the file and run it on the local machine (Google Chrome)
Login with your Gmail account which your University gives and access that account for it.
Next steps are as follows - 
1. Open Google Colab [Google Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Go to Google Colab.
You can create a new notebook by clicking "New Notebook" or open an existing one from Google Drive or GitHub.
2. Set Up Your Notebook
The Colab notebook interface looks similar to Jupyter notebooks, with code cells where you can enter code.
To add a code cell, click on the "+" Code" button.
3. Write or Paste Code
In the code cell, you can type or paste your code.
Colab supports Python by default, but you can also use other languages with a few tweaks (such as running shell commands by prefixing with !).
4. Run the Code Cell
To execute the code, press Shift + Enter or click the Play button on the left side of the cell.
Colab will initialize a virtual machine and connect you to it, which might take a few seconds.
5. Accessing Files
You can upload files directly to Colab using the Files sidebar.
Alternatively, you can access files from Google Drive by running:
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
6. Allow the warnings to access your Google Drive account and you can use the jupyter environment
You can save your progress in Google Drive by going to File > Save.
To share the notebook, click Share and set the permissions.

Note- I have provided the link to individual Kerala.csv and Conditional Probability is given here inside the [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zipwlVcK0tKeCTMTA9w4DiR4Aijyspmx?usp=drive_link)

## Using Kaggle Notebooks

1. Go to [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. Create an account using the official email provided by the university, then come back here and open the link below to access it.
3. [Kaggle.com/AshainX/conditional-probability](https://www.kaggle.com/ashainx/conditional-probability)
4. On the top right corner you will see the Copy&Edit button, click on that. It will open a new window with the same contents and you can experiment with it
5. Remember - Click on the section you want to run and press CTRL+Enter to run that particular section, starting from the beginning of the notebook.


# Videos I will recommend you guys go through to learn more about probability importance in machine learning 
If you feel like you want to learn how these mathematical things works in training a machine logic then you can start from the basics of Machine learning and deep learning
