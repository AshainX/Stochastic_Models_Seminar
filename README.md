## How to access the file and run it on the local machine
Login with your Gmail account which your University gives and access that account for it.
Next steps are as follows - 
1. Open Google Colab [Google Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Go to Google Colab.
You can create a new notebook by clicking "New Notebook" or open an existing one from Google Drive or GitHub.
2. Set Up Your Notebook
The Colab notebook interface looks similar to Jupyter notebooks, with code cells where you can enter code.
To add a code cell, click on the "+" Code" button.
3. Write or Paste Code
In the code cell, you can type or paste your code.
Colab supports Python by default, but you can also use other languages with a few tweaks (such as running shell commands by prefixing with !).
4. Run the Code Cell
To execute the code, press Shift + Enter or click the Play button on the left side of the cell.
Colab will initialize a virtual machine and connect you to it, which might take a few seconds.
5. Accessing Files
You can upload files directly to Colab using the Files sidebar.
Alternatively, you can access files from Google Drive by running:
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
6. Save and Share the Notebook
You can save your progress in Google Drive by going to File > Save.
To share the notebook, click Share and set the permissions.
